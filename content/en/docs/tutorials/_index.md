Tutorials are have been created as a functional learning resource, with the "power user" in mind.  The tutorials explain how to build and operate a simple multi-node (VM) cluster.  When it it came to building a development cluster, I felt I could not find sufficient resource that made this process easy so I created these resources.

Of course there are several examples projects that create all-in-one single node clusters, but I wanted something that would be "most like" a real production cluster.
